// Production CBv2 engine construction over an ALREADY-LOADED model.
//
// `EngineV2Factory.makeBridge` takes the engine as a closure so the
// refusal/telemetry logic stays engine-agnostic and unit-testable with a
// scripted stub. This file supplies the closure's production body: assemble
// the real `MLXLMCommon.EngineV2` from the model the provider just loaded
// (no re-download, no second weight copy — the engine retains the same
// module instance retained by the loaded model container) plus the runtime
// pieces:
//
//   * layer kinds, capabilities, and per-layer caches from the model's own
//     CBv2 hooks (Gemma 4 text, GPT-OSS, Qwen3.5 MoE target, and direct
//     Qwen3-VL wrapper; GPT-OSS also primes its sinks probe at build time),
//   * a KV backend sized from the unified-memory KV budget —
//     `PagedKVBackend` for an explicit "paged", slabs capped by
//     `PagedKVPhysicalCapacityPolicy` and committed lazily
//     (`.atFirstAdmission`); `CBv2ContiguousKVBackend` for "auto" (v0.8.1
//     reverts the default to contiguous; the argument is at
//     `case .auto: resolvedKind` below), an explicit "contiguous", a slot
//     veto, or the kill switch,
//   * `CBv2LayerCacheBank` over the model-built caches,
//   * `CBv2DefaultSampler` + `CBv2TextDetokenizerFactory` (real incremental
//     detokenization with stop-string holdback).
//
// Any throw here lands in `makeBridge`'s catch (v0.7.5 fail-loud): ERROR
// `engine_health` telemetry (`operation=engine_v2_refusal`) + rethrow —
// the load fails with a 503 and the coordinator reroutes. There is no
// legacy engine to fall back to.
//
// An EXPLICITLY requested paged backend that cannot be built takes that
// same route: `pagedUnavailable` rather than a quiet contiguous engine,
// so a paged benchmark or e2e run can never report paged and measure
// contiguous. `.auto` and the fleet kill switch still degrade.

        // curve (1.27x aggregate decode B=4->B=8 against contiguous's
        // 1.07x, plus faster long prefill), and this revert knowingly gives
        // back ~15% aggregate decode at B=8 on gemma-4/M4 Max to buy back
        // 10x the KV. Capacity dominates because a request that is never
        // admitted has no decode rate at all.
        //
        // WHAT THIS COSTS, and where it is paid. The v0.8.0 evidence stands
        // — measured on the real slot path with the SSD tier, six arms,
        // backend label confirmed on every one, cold-twin byte-identical
        // throughout. Prefix-cache ADOPTION exactness:
