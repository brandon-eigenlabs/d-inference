// Process-wide registry of active `EngineV2Bridge` instances (one per
// v2-served model). This is the single seam the existing `ProviderLoop`
// plumbing hooks into:
//
//   * `ProviderLoop+Capacity.updateAggregateCapacity` folds
//     `capacitySummary()` slots into the existing heartbeat wire shape.
//   * `ProviderLoop+Cancellation.handleCancellation` fans the coordinator
//     request-id out through `cancel(requestId:)` → `CBv2Engine.cancel`.
//
// Both hooks guard on `ProviderLoop.hasEngineV2Slots` before hopping here,
// so a provider with no loaded model avoids the actor hop.
