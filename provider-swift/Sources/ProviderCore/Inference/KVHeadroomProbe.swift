// Live KV-headroom probe — scheduler-free home (v0.7.5).
//
// Re-homed from the retired `BatchScheduler+Telemetry` implementation's
// `measuredLiveKVHeadroomBytes` / `hasServeableKVHeadroom`: pure
// `UnifiedMemoryCap` math over the live MLX + OS memory counters, used by
// the post-load guard in `ensureModelLoaded` (a model that loads with no
// serveable KV headroom is unloaded + 503'd instead of advertising a slot
// whose every request the KV gate would reject).
