/// StartupPreloader -- sequential boot-time model preload with memory
/// admission and an optional per-model self-test decode.
///
/// Fixes the fleet-rollover cold-start failure mode: after a release restart
/// the provider used to register (and attract routing) with NOTHING loaded, so
/// first requests paid the full multi-GB weight load + engine build inside a
/// live request — and at a fleet-wide rollover every box was cold at once
/// (first_chunk_timeout storm). This component loads the configured /
/// previously-served model set BEFORE the caller opens the coordinator
/// connection.
///
/// Design rules:
///   * **Sequential.** Loads are serialized (the `ProviderLoop` load gate
///     serializes them anyway); one at a time keeps eviction decisions and
///     memory admission deterministic.
///   * **Preload never evicts.** Each candidate is admitted only if its
///     weights + serve headroom fit what is free RIGHT NOW; otherwise it is
///     skipped with a WARN. Loading a later candidate must never churn out an
///     earlier preloaded model — the lazy-load path remains the fallback for
///     skipped models.
///   * **Failures degrade, never crash.** A failed load or self-test logs,
///     optionally emits telemetry, and moves on. Fail-open is the default: a
///     model whose self-test failed stays advertised (availability beats
///     perfection); `selfTestFailClosed` opts into retiring it.
///
/// All side effects are injected so the sequencing is unit-testable with
/// scripted loaders — no model weights, no network, no MLX.
